        <h3> You can use this skill to cause an opponent to become <b>SHAKEN</b> for a number of rounds. This shaken condition doesn’t stack with other shaken conditions to make an affected creature frightened. The DC of this check is equal to <b style="color: red;"> 10 + the target’s Hit Dice + the target’s Wisdom modifier.</b>
<br>
<br>
Success: If you are successful, the target is shaken for one round. This duration <b>increases by 1 round for every 5 by which you beat the DC</b>. You can only threaten an opponent this way if it is within 30 feet and can clearly see and hear you. Using demoralize on the same creature only extends the duration; it does not create a stronger fear condition.
<br>
<br>
Fail: The opponent is not shaken.
<br>
<br>
Action Demoralizing an opponent is a standard action.
<br>
<br>
Retry? You can attempt to intimidate an opponent again, but each additional check increases the DC by +5. This increase resets after one hour has passed. </h3>
