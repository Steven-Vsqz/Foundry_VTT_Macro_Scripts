## Macros in a nutshell
<p>
Macros in Foundry VTT are highly useful as they automate repetitive tasks, such as rolling dice or managing character abilities, enhancing game efficiency. They streamline gameplay by reducing manual input, allowing game masters and players to focus more on storytelling and strategy. Macros ensure consistency and accuracy in game mechanics, reducing the potential for human error. Additionally, they can be customized to fit specific needs, such as automating complex combat sequences or managing inventory. This flexibility saves time and enhances the gaming experience, making sessions smoother and more enjoyable for everyone involved.

## Healing Spell and Potion Tracker

</summary>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  This script helps you manage your healing spells and potions/extracts in Foundry VTT. It shows a dialog box where you can pick a spell from a list (like Cure Light Wounds), and it tells you how many prepared charges are left. 
  <br />
  <br />
  
  If you choose a spell, it automatically subtracts one charge and updates your character sheet.
  ```lua
  // Subtract 1 charge
      preparedAmount -= 1;
  
  // Update the spell with the new preparedAmount
      await spell.update({ "data.preparation.preparedAmount": preparedAmount });
  ```
  It also checks your inventory for any potions or extracts that start with "Potion of Cure" or "Extract of Cure" and shows you how many you have left.
  
  ```lua
  // Search for potions and extracts in the inventory
      const inventoryItems = actor.items.filter(item => item.name.startsWith("Potion of Cure") || item.name.startsWith("Extract of Cure"));
      let itemQuantities = {};
      inventoryItems.forEach(item => {
      itemQuantities[item.name] = item.data.data.quantity || 0;
      });
  ```
  A simply and clean interface. It provides you with the information you need without having to manually view your resources.

## Sneak Attack
</summary>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  When you want to apply sneak attack damage in your game, this macro gets your rogue's level, figures out how many dice you should roll, and pops up a dialog box. You can choose to roll the damage with a bit of stylish flavor text or skip it for now. Itâ€™s a fun way to   add some flair to your sneak attacks!
  <br />
  <br />
  
  Calculates how many sneak attack dice you get based on your rogue level. Doesn't have to be only rogues, any class that grants you sneak attack can be placed here. Just change the classes.(class) to the one you want.
  ```lua
  // Calculate the number of sneak attack dice
    let rogueLevel = actor.classes.rogue?.level || 0;
    let numDice = Math.ceil(rogueLevel / 2);
  ```
  ![Sneak Attack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82e4eabb-8c8c-40c6-8d4a-c2ab19b7eaa5)

  Just to add some stylish flavor text to the attack, the script randomly picks from a list of pre-made phrases to display. 
  ```lua
  // Function to get a random flavor
    function getRandomFlavor() {
      return flavors[Math.floor(Math.random() * flavors.length)];
    }
  ```

## Example Usage

I developed and applied a macro to a feature named Cornugon Smash. This macro was integrated with a weapon, ensuring that when the weapon is used, it performs a conditional check to determine if the player has the "Power Attack" ability enabled. Upon confirmation, the macro triggers a dialog box that prompts the player with the option to utilize the Cornugon Smash ability. This enhancement streamlines the decision-making process during gameplay and provides an intuitive user interface for ability management.
